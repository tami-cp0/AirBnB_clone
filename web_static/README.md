# Web Static
### **Description**
This is the second part of the AirBnB clone project where I worked on developing the static components of a website; specifically, the non-dynamic elements that remain constant and don't change based on user input or server-side processing. Currently, these only include HTML and CSS that contribute to the visual presentation and layout of a web page.
