## Console
### **Description**

This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project where I worked on creating the console. It is a sandbox that aims to manipulate data without a visual interface.

This is not a client side console, It will be used for development and debugging.
### Installation and Usage
To install, clone the repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/tami-cp0/AirBnB_clone.git
```
Enter the directory and run the console using this command:
```
cd AirBnB_clone && ./console.py
```
> run `help` to see all available commands
> or run `help <command>` to Description and Usage of a command.
